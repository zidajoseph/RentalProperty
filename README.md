## Overview of the web application.
Please implement a CRUD for the rental property information screen. We already have the source code of the application that we just rails new. Please use this template to develop it.


If you are familiar with Ruby on Rails, we estimate that it should take 1-2 hours to complete the project.

We will use the text in the diver.

The details are there.




### Specification.
- Please create the same screen as the attached image.
- Please implement the nearest station information with consideration, as the number may increase.
